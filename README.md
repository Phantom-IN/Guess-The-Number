# Guess the Number Game
This is the Java based game where user has to find the correct number that has been randomly picked by program.

## Working
- When the code is executed the program select a random number in between 0-1000. 
- Now the user has to guess that number. 
- User can enter his guess in TextField available. 
- If the number guessed by user is greater than actual number the background will turn red and 'Too high' message will be shown. 
- Similarly, if the guessed number is smaller that the actual number, the background will turn blue and 'Too low message will be shown'. 
- Once the guessed number is equal to the actual number the background will change to white and message saying 'correct' will be displayed.
- At any moment the user can choose to play again.
